# Scala TypeSystem Playground

## What is this? 
A project to illustrate the differences between a Inheritance-Based Polymorphism and Instance-Based Polymorphism.

## Examples

For the [example](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon), a selection of Pok√©mon are modeled with the goal of providing a handful of behaviors, `Moves`, `PrimaryType`, an optional `SecondaryType`, and a way to indicate evolutionary trees.

An implementation is given using [inheritance based polymorphism](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon/inheritance), as well as one using [instance based polymorphism](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon/instances). 

While the approaches are slightly different, both implementations are [able to provide the same API](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon/test).

In the [inheritance based polymorphism](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon/inheritance) example, code tends to be organized by domain objects. 
While in the [instance based polymorphism](/src/test/scala/sandbox/pokemon/instances) example, code is organized by behavior that it provides.
